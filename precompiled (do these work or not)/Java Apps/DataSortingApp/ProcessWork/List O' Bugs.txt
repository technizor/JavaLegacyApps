- MinMax Rank does not rank properly (actually just sorts it). 
	- could it be a problem with the constructor method??
		- verified. not a problem with the constructor, but i streamlined all the
		  constructors to reduce redundancy
	- maybe the cause is the rank method in the ISort(gotta rename this thing) abstract
	  class??
		- doesnt make much sense bc/ it shares that rank function with the other sorts.
	- could it be a neglected variable that i forgot to change in the minmax sort for
	    determining the min and the max?? this is the most likely case.
		- nope. not a missed variable. must be something else.
	- fixed! problem was in the moving of the subelements in that particular sort.

- when "Input has headers" is selected, the input file reader skips one element.
	- fixed it so that it will not skip any elements and will ensure that if that box is
	  checked, it will only save the first line read as the headers.

- you cannot rank or sort text elements because currently it only supports numbers (greater than
  and lesser than operations are required, and LSD radix needs to be overhauled to have letter
  buckets.
	- fixed for every available sort excluding the LSD radix sort (if you want a radix sort
	  for text you will require the MSD radix sort instead)

- nothing else so far!
	- amazing!
